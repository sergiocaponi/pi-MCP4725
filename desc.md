A Python module for the Raspberry Pi to interface with the MCP4725 IÂ²C Digital-to-Analogue Converter. (https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/22039d.pdf) 

Tested on Python 3.9 on a Raspberry Pi Zero W v1.1, but should be compatible with most Raspberry Pi models running the latest version of Python.

Module works with Microchip's MCP4725 DAC.
